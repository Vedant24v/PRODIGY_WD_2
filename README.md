* **Precision Timing:** Tracks hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds with high accuracy.
* **Smart Lap System:**
* Record individual lap times without stopping the clock.
* Laps are automatically numbered.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Structured for a clean, semantic digital display.
* **CSS3:** Implements custom variables, radial gradients, and `@keyframes` animations for the "bg-animate" effect.
* **JavaScript:** Handles the core logic using `setInterval` (10ms intervals) and DOM manipulation for real-time updates.
* **Google Fonts:** Utilizes 'Orbitron' and 'Rajdhani' for a high-tech, digital look.
